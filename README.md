Our game is based off of the Prime television show “The Summer I Turned Pretty”. In the show, Belly Conklin navigates her feeling for 2 brothers, Jeremiah and Conrad Fisher, both of whom she has know for all her life. We model the game off of this idea with the goal/win state of Belly proposing to Conrad (the better brother in our opinion) and the lose state Belly proposing to Jeremiah or jumping off the roof. In order to accomplish this, Belly has to find the infinity necklace Conrad gave her (in her room), repair it using the hammer found on the roof, wear it, get the ring from Jeremiah’s room by giving Laurel (her mom) cupcakes as she disapproves of Belly marrying anyone so young, then find Conrad on the beach and propose to him. 
We decided to choose this as our topic because the interactive aspect reminded us of the show and we wanted to make better decisions than Belly and thought to make this our game! And the 3rd season just cane out, so we felt even more inspired to pursue this. We also thought the actions/choices Belly makes throughout the show could be modeled/replicated well within our game. Enjoy!
